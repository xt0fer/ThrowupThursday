# Throwup Thursday

*Use Spring, and HAL Browser (for Spring Data REST) to create a couple of POJOs (Book and Person) and
a framework so that we can mock up some data in spring, and then generate
JSON and other marvels.*

**Run and then point a browser to [http://localhost:8080/]()**

## New and Improved!! As seen ov TV! 
## ThrowupThursday can now talk to a MySQL db running on your machine.

Yes, that's right, you can do a very simple CRUDRepository in Spring to suply the data you need!

You're welcome.

## New and Improved! Now with the earth-shattering SimpleMonday Client!!

Then open VSC on the SAME project. Go into frontend/SimpleMonday and find a simple Ionic 3 client, which can talk to the 
Spring server above, fetch a single GET from the server display the results in the People tab of the 
SimpleMonday client.
